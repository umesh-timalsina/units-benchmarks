# Units Benchmarks
This repository contains baseline benchmarks for comparing different unit packages in python. Specifically, current packages of interest are:

1. [unyt](https://github.com/yt-project/unyt)
2. [pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint)


## The Plan
The plan(subject to change) is to explore the packages' api and compare the following aspects of the packages:

1. Package import times
2. Serialization and hashing support and performance
3. Support for various unit systems and quantities
4. Other minor package features etc...
